# websocket client pure lua implement for love2d and lovepotion

Event-driven websocket client for love2d in pure lua, which aims to be simple and easy to use.
Adjusted to work for lovepotion on Nintendo 3DS (not tested on switch):
* Bitwise operations done using luabit.lua from [lua-msgpack](https://github.com/kengonakajima/lua-msgpack)
* goto replaced with a janky while-do loop

Not all websocket features are implemented, but it works fine. Tested with aiohttp(python) and ws(nodejs) library.

## Quick start
Just copy `websocket.lua` to your project directory, and write code as the following example.

```lua
local client = require("websocket").new("127.0.0.1", 5000)
function client:onmessage(message)
    print(message)
end
function client:onopen()
    self:send("hello from love2d")
    self:close()
end
function client:onclose(code, reason)
    print("closecode: "..code..", reason: "..reason)
end

function love.update()
    client:update()
end
```

## WSS connection
If you need wss connection(websocket with TLS), you can use [LuaSec](https://github.com/brunoos/luasec) with this library, or just use [lÃ¶ve-ws](https://github.com/holywyvern/love-ws).

## API
* `websocket.new(host: string, port: int, path?: string) -> client`
* `function client:onopen()`
* `function client:onmessage(message: string)`
* `function client:onerror(error: string)`
* `function client:onclose(code: int, reason: string)`
* `client.status -> int`
* `client:send(message: string)`
* `client:close(code?: int, reason?: string)`
* `client:update()`
